# Use LLVM style as a base
BasedOnStyle: LLVM

# --- Indentation ---
IndentWidth: 4
UseTab: Never
ContinuationIndentWidth: 4

# --- Line Breaking ---
ColumnLimit: 0

# --- Function Call Arguments ---
# This stops it from breaking after the multi-line lambda argument.
BinPackArguments: false

# --- Chained Calls (.def) ---
# LLVM style usually breaks before the dot and indents correctly
# with ContinuationIndentWidth when the line exceeds the ColumnLimit.
# Since ColumnLimit is 0 and BinPackArguments is false, breaks are less likely.

# --- Braces ---
BreakBeforeBraces: Attach
AllowShortBlocksOnASingleLine: false
AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine: None
AllowShortLambdasOnASingleLine: None # Keep multi-line lambda structure
